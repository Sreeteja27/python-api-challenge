Three observable trends:

1.Temperatures are higher at latitudes closer to the equator. Temperatures are lower towards the earth's poles.
2.The temperature does increase significantly between -20 degrees and approx latitude 25 degrees.
3.The datasets for cloudiness and wind speed show some outliers, but overall don't seem to have any correlation to latitude, or proximity to the equator.
